# Data Warehouse Project for Retail Company Analysis

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing the business performance of a retail company that operates through various sales channels. The key activities include extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data into a Data Warehouse, creating jobs for data transformation using Talend, and visualizing the data with Tableau and PowerBI.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Talend for ETL processes.
- Tableau and PowerBI for data visualization.
- Access to source systems (Databases, Flat files, Excel sheets, etc.).

### Installation
1. **Download Source Files:** 
   - Ensure you have access to the necessary source systems and files.
2. **Database Setup:**
   - Create the required databases in your system as per the project's data schema.

### Talend Setup
1. **Import Project:**
   - Download `newfinal.zip`.
   - Open Talend and import the `newfinal.zip` project file.
   - Make the necessary connections to your databases and source files.

### Data Transformation
- The project includes multiple jobs for handling different dimensions and fact models.
- There is a Master job designed to run 45 individual jobs with a single click.

### Optimization
- The Master job is tuned to reduce execution time by approximately 30 minutes.

### Implementing Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)
- SCDs are used to track historical and current prices.

## Data Visualization
- **Tableau and PowerBI:**
  - Use the provided visualization files in Tableau and PowerBI.
  - Visualizations include sales analysis by geography, product, period comparisons, reject analysis, etc.

### Dashboards
- Custom dashboards are designed to provide a comprehensive overview at a glance.

## Running the Project
- After setting up the databases and importing the Talend project, run the Master job.
- Open the visualization files with Tableau and PowerBI to view the reports and dashboards.

## Notes
- Ensure all connections to source systems are properly configured before running the ETL jobs.
- For detailed analysis, refer to the specific documentation within the Talend project and visualization tools.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the comprehensive process of data warehousing and business intelligence for a retail company, encompassing ETL processes, data modeling, and visualization.
